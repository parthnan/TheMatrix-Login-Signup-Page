# TheMatrix-Login-Signup-Page
Project in HTML-CSS-Javascript to design a login, signup webpage. The chosen theme is full on Retro based on The Matrix Movie series!! Made way back in 2014. 

A still of the login page is as below. It links to the facebook pages of the coding club at university. Used some funky Javascript to create the Matrix-esque Green waterfall of symbols in the background!
